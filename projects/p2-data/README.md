## Week 16 - Agile Methodologies and Project 2

### Overview

This week's lesson will introduce students to some more Agile methodologies and workflows. This is also a project week so classes will be split evenly between presentation of new material and independent work.

* **The requirements for Project #2 are as follows:**

  * Must use a Node and Express Web Server

  * Must be backed by a MySQL Database with a Sequelize ORM  

  * Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data

  * Must be deployed using Heroku (with Data)

  * Must utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed

  * Must have a polished frontend / UI 

  * Must have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm

  * Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)

  * Must not expose sensitive API key information on the server, see [Protecting-API-Keys-In-Node.md](../../class-content/10-nodejs/Supplemental/Protecting-API-Keys-In-Node.md)

* Special Note: Cake/cupcake themes are banned from use except for the 2 that won the Project Proposal Challenge (But you can create a cupcake prototype website for submission to my client anyway - it just won't count for Project 2). However, that should not stop you from using technologies that businesses want you to create/use. Not only that, if you do not have the ability to predict what a client wants, I want you to learn how create code that can be adapted for other websites and possible future cases. Amateur developers have ideas. Good developers can write code from ideas and implement them. Great developers start projects that can grow and evolve without even knowing what the final project looks like.
