This is a blatant copy of another activity. However, it is repurposed for the review.

We need HTML routes and links to work first.

We need to make a route to place an order.

If the order is more than what the bakery can handle, put it in the waitlist (Bakery can handle 12 orders per day).

If the bakery has free time, put it in the orders for today.

There should be a route to be able to list orders.

The home page should link to either route.

Every person should be up at the front typing for at least 5 minutes.
