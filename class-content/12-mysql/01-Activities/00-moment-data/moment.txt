You see I been waiting
Waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That moment, is close
Tired of living day to day like everything is alright
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin' syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, n****s finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don't let 'em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin' for a rent sign
Upper echelon, b**** we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon' win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon' get here
Pyrex vision, made more than I ever made with DTP this year
Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
Every night just one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say how you got that s***, hell
Next time that's mine
Long as I stay hustlin I'm gon' shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
Just waiting on my moment
Bad hoes I'm showin'
Time came and I owned it
Just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touch the rock I cracked the block
When I pulled up in that muscle drop
With that roof off and my shoes off
On you b**** n****s, RuPaul
Real n**** in my hood, who err'body gon' root for
They see my come from that bottom
Where err'body get bodied
They told me get em, I got em
Now I'm here n**** like yeah n****
Just Rolls Royce and Bugattis
And m4 this year n****
If I don't grind, I don't shine
If I don't shine, then I don' eat
Won't eat, then Ima starve
If I'ma starve, I pull heat
On all yall b**** ass n****s
All y'all rich ass n****s
'Cause if I don' make no money n****
I'm gon' take yo money n****
Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
Every night just one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say how you got that s***, hell
Next time that's mine
Long as I stay hustlin' I'm gon' shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
Since life ain't promised tomorrow
Live it up live it up live it up
Here before it come this far
Give it up give it up give it up
"I won't" give it up give it up give up
Until I have it all, yeah!
Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
Every night just one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say how you got that s***, hell
Next time that's mine
Long as I stay hustlin' I'm gon' shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
