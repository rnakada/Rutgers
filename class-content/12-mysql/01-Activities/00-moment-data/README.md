# Moment Processor

* Write a command line operation to read a line and print out the line if it has the word "moment" in it.

  * `node moment.js line Waiting for my moment` should console log "Waiting for my moment"
  * `node moment.js line Waiting for a chicken` should have no output

* Re-write the same function to read a file instead and then print all the lines of that file have the word "moment"
  * `node moment.js file moment.txt` should print multiple lines from the file that have the word moment
